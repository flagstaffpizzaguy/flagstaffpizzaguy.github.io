This repository contains The Pizza Guy's website, which is currently being hosted on Github Pages ([flagstaffpizzaguy.github.io](https://flagstaffpizzaguy.github.io/)). The website was developed by Matthew Nemmer ([matt-nemmer.github.io](https://matt-nemmer.github.io/)). Development began in August of 2022 and was initiated to address several problems with the previous website:

* Loading slowly - From the Flagstaff area on a PC, the website took roughly 20 seconds to load and become usable.
* Inclusion of invisible or non-functional content - It appears there was once Facebook, Google Maps, and additional content on the site that were no longer functional. As a result, there were large blank spaces on some web page, invisible links that could still be clicked, and commented out code that was presumably broken.
* Outdated content and design style - The design was not aesthetic enough to compete with modern restaurant websites. Also, there was incorrent information and pricing present on the site.
* Poor code design - There were serveal issues in the website's code that would negatively impact Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

The only remaining task is to set up the appropriate DNS records so that the business's domain ([flagstaffpizzaguy.com](http://flagstaffpizzaguy.com/)) will direct user's to the content stored in this repository.
